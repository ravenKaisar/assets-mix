# Assets MIX
This is especially wonderful for people that want to use webpack, but feel like configuring webpack is too difficult. Or maybe they wanted to use ES2016 but saw some complicated article about loaders and modules.

Assets MIX allows you to use a single line to describe what you want and it'll use it's preconfigured settings to process it properly.

## Requirements 
> For this tutorial, I assume that you have basic knowledge of managing JSON files and that you have NPM and Node installed on your system.

> To verify that you have NPM and Node, you can run the following in your terminal:
 
```
node -v
npm -v
```
> You should see versions for both Node and NPM.
